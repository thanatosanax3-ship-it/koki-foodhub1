## 🚀 5-Minute Deployment Process

### STEP 1: Create Render Account
```
1. Open https://render.com in browser
2. Click "Sign Up" (or "Sign In" if you have account)
3. Use GitHub to sign up (fastest option)
4. Authorize GitHub access
```

### STEP 2: Deploy Web Service
```
1. Click "+ New" button (top right)
2. Select "Web Service"
3. Click "Connect repository"
4. Search for "koki-foodhub"
5. Click "Connect"
```

### STEP 3: Configure Service
```
Render will show form with auto-detected settings:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Service Name: koki-foodhub          │
│ Environment: Python 3               │
│ Region: Oregon (or nearest)         │
│ Plan: Free (or Starter)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt && \
               python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

Start Command: gunicorn koki_foodhub.wsgi

Branch: main
```

✅ Click "Create Web Service"

### STEP 4: Add Environment Variables

While service is building, add these:

```
Click "Environment" tab

Variable 1:
Key: DEBUG
Value: False

Variable 2:
Key: SECRET_KEY
Value: [GENERATE BELOW]

Variable 3:
Key: ALLOWED_HOSTS
Value: Leave empty (Render provides it)
```

**Generate SECRET_KEY (run in PowerShell):**
```powershell
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

Example output:
```
a$w4x!z@q#r1t-p%y_u&v^o*i(j)k-l+m=n
```
👆 Copy and paste this in SECRET_KEY field

### STEP 5: Connect Existing Database

Since you already have a free PostgreSQL database on Render:

```
1. Go to https://render.com/dashboard
2. Click on your existing PostgreSQL database
3. Copy the Internal Database URL (starts with postgresql://)
   (It looks like: postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname)
4. Go back to Web Service
5. Click "Environment" tab
6. Add new variable:
   Key: DATABASE_URL
   Value: [paste the connection string]
7. Click "Save"
```

✅ Your web service will now use your existing database!

**If you need to delete old database first:**
```
1. Go to dashboard
2. Find any old/unused database
3. Click it → Click "Delete" button
4. Then come back to web service and add DATABASE_URL
```

### STEP 6: Wait for Build ⏳

```
Watch the Logs tab for:
✓ Fetching code...
✓ Installing dependencies...
✓ Running build command...
✓ Collecting static files...
✓ Service is running...

Expected time: 2-5 minutes
```

### STEP 7: Initialize Database

After "Service is running":

```
1. Click "Shell" tab
2. Run migrations:
   $ python manage.py migrate

3. Create admin user:
   $ python manage.py createsuperuser
   
   Enter username: admin
   Enter email: admin@example.com
   Enter password: [your password]
```

```

**502 Bad Gateway**
```
→ Check web server logs
→ Verify SECRET_KEY is set
→ Make sure database is connected
```

**Static Files (404)**
```
